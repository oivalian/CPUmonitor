# CPmonitor

## What is CPmonitor?
CPMonitor  displays basic system information through tkinker GUI such as:

1) Device Details (Name, OS and version)
2) CPU information (Brand, load, speed, cores/core breakdown)
3) Memory (installed, available and used)
4) Mounted Drives (Mounted letter, Type, Size)
5) GPU Information (Brand, memory, load, temp)

## Required packages
CPmonitor uses the following packages:
`psutil`
`platform`
`py-cpuinfo`
`GPUtil`
`tkinter`
`ttkbootstrap`


## Planned addons

- Executable
- Live graphs for CPU and GPU temps and loads
- CPU temp and core additions
- Connected peripherals
- More hardware information

> [!NOTE]
> There are probably much better ways of presenting this, but as it evolves and my skills improve, CPmonitor will also.
